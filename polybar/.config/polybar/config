; The throttle settings lets the eventloop swallow up til X events
; if they happen within Y millisecond after first event was received.
; This is done to prevent flood of update event.
;
; For example if 5 modules emit an update event at the same time, we really
; just care about the last one. But if we wait too long for events to swallow
; the bar would appear sluggish so we continue if timeout
; expires or limit is reached.
